# Digit Sum Calculator

This is a simple Java console application that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer.

## 💡 How It Works

The user is prompted to enter a number. The program then calculates how many digits the number has, and finally sums up all digits one by one using modulus and division operations.

## 🧪 Example

```
Please enter a number: 1234
Sum of digits: 10
```

## 📁 Project Structure
